# random-lab

A playground for experimenting with Markov chains and probability distributions.

From raw sequences of states to a formal **transition matrix** \(P\), and then to how distributions evolve:

$$
\mu_n = \mu_0 P^n, \quad \pi = \pi P, \quad \sum_i \pi_i = 1
$$

## Visualization

The goal of the project is to **visualize results** with:

- heatmaps of the transition matrix,
- distribution plots showing evolution over time.
